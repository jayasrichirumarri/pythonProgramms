# 1.what is python?
# python was created by guido van rossum,and released in 1991.
# it is a general purpose object oriented programming language.
# it is platform independent.it is widely used in machine learning,artificial intelligence,and web development.
# it is easy to learn and require less code to build an application.

# 2. why python?
# python is interpreted ,object orinted ,and procedural language.it is user friendly language.
# and it is dynamically typed.it is also used as scripting language.
# it has many libraries and functions with that we can build any application in less time.
# it can work with different platforms like windows ,macos,and linux etc.

# applications of 0python?
# web and internet development
# games
# operating systems
# GUI based desktop applications

# advantages of python?
# interpreted language
# dynamically typed
# english like syntax
# object oriented
# free and open source language
# it has in built data structure.
# platform independent and portable
# Automatic memory management

# what is pep8?
# pep8 stands for Python Enhancement Proposal.it is
# a python coading convention.it has a set of recommendations about how to use python code more readable.
# it provides the readability and consistency for python code.

# what is pickling and unpickling?
# pickling is the process whereby python object is converted into bytestream.it is also known as serialization.
# unpickling is the process where that byte stream is again converted into python object hierarchy.
# it is also known as de-serialization.
# for pickling we use dump() method.and for unpickling we use load() method.

# how is python interpreted?
# python is an interpreted language.for that we use pvm(python virtual machine).
# in this the code will executed line by line.
# internally it compiled and execute instructions directly.
# source code converted into intermediate language then to machine language and it can be executed.

# what are python decorators ?
# python decorators are the functions which can be used in functions and that provides extra functionality to the
# existing functions with out effecting the original functons.it provides bottom up appraoch.

# differentiate b/w list and tuple
# list are mutable.it consumes more memory. and it has some built in methods.it can be edited.
# tuples are immutable. it consumes less memory.it has the count() and index() methods.it cannot be edited.

# difference between modules and package?
# each python program is a module.module is a way to structure the program.
# the folder of a python modules(programs) is called a package.

# how are argument passed by value or by reference?
# everything in python is an object, and all the variables hold references to the objects.therefore
# we cannot change the value of the references.however ,we can change the object if it is mutable.

# what is lambda in python?
# lambda is an anonymous function it is used when in a project if want a particular function for short period
# of time we use lambda.example filter ,map,reduce etc.
# it takes any no of arguments but it has only one expression.

# what is break,continue, pass in python?
# pass: pass is a stmt it used when we want to put a block empty it gives an error.
# so instead of putting empty block we say pass so it exicuted.generally we use it as a place holder.
# break: it will jump out of the block. remaining stmts also not exicuted or printed.
# continue: it skip perticular iteration and continue remaining part.

# what are iterators in python?
# iterators are used to iterate over a group of elements.
# for that we use iter() and next() methods.

# what are generaters in python ?
# the way of implementing these iterators is known as generators.
# it yields an expression in the function.we use the "yield" keyword.

# what is slicing in python?

# the slice() function returns a slice object.it is used to slice any sequance.like string,list ,tuple,range or byte.
# it is having start ,stop ,step parameters.

# docstring in python?
# it is a documentation string.it is a multiline string.
# it is the way of documenting python functions and modules.

# what is the xrange and range?
# xrange returns the range object.
# range returns the list

# use of the split function in python?
# split function is used to break a string into smaller strings and it returns alist of strings.

# difference between remove() and del[] and pop()?
# remove() is used to delete a particular element in a sequence.ex:list.remove(2)
# by using del[:] we give the index nos from where to where we want to delete a sequence.ex:del list[1:3]
# pop(): removes element by index.ex:list.pop(1)

# wt is the use of join()?
# it is used in strings if we want to concatinate the strings we use join().

# wt is type conversion?
# we can convert one datatype to another datatype.
# int(),float(),hex(),prd(),oct(),tuple(),set(),dict(),list(),str()

# wt is the difference between array and list?
# arrays can hold only datatype elements.
# list can hold different datatype of elements.

# wt is __init__ in python?
# init is a constructor or a method .it is used in classes.
# when we create object/instance of the class the init method automatically called to a separate memory location.
# no need to call init method it automatically calls.every class has a init method.

# wt is the self in python?
# self is an instance of a class or an object.it is the first parameter.
# ithelps to differentiate b/w the methods and attributes of a class with local variables.

# how multithreading achieved in python?
# in python multithreading is achieved through context switching.

# memory management in python?
# private heap containing python objects and data structures
# allocation of heap space for python objects taken care by the python memory manager.
# built in garbage collector recycles all unused memory.

# wt is python dictionary?
# dictionary are map datatype,these are mutable.
# it stores data as key value pairs.
# all the keys in dictionary ar to be unique.

# wt are //,%,** in python?
# //:floor  division   returns integer value
# % :modulus           returns remainder
# **:exponent             a**b    means a raised to the power of b

# deep copy v/s shallow copy
# deep copy: creates new and separate copy of the objects and its elements.
# any change made in new copy doesnt eflect the original one.
# shallow copy: creates copy of the object but rather than copying the elements of
# the object,it copies the references to their memory addresses.
# any change made to the copy reflects in the original one.
